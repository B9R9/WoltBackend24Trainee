## Introduction

Your task is to write a delivery fee calculator. This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and we’d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance.

## Task Description
Your task is to build an HTTP API which could be used for calculating the delivery fee.

### Specification
Implement an HTTP API (single POST endpoint) which calculates the delivery fee based on the information in the request payload (JSON) and includes the calculated delivery fee in the response payload (JSON).

#### Request
Example: 
```json
{"cart_value": 790, "delivery_distance": 2235, "number_of_items": 4, "time": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z"}
```

### Specification
Rules for calculating a delivery fee
* If the cart value is less than 10€, a small order surcharge is added to the delivery price. The surcharge is the difference between the cart value and 10€. For example if the cart value is 8.90€, the surcharge will be 1.10€.
* A delivery fee for the first 1000 meters (=1km) is 2€. If the delivery distance is longer than that, 1€ is added for every additional 500 meters that the courier needs to travel before reaching the destination. Even if the distance would be shorter than 500 meters, the minimum fee is always 1€.
  * Example 1: If the delivery distance is 1499 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the additional 500 m => 3€
  * Example 2: If the delivery distance is 1500 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the additional 500 m => 3€
  * Example 3: If the delivery distance is 1501 meters, the delivery fee is: 2€ base fee + 1€ for the first 500 m + 1€ for the second 500 m => 4€
* If the number of items is five or more, an additional 50 cent surcharge is added for each item above and including the fifth item. An extra "bulk" fee applies for more than 12 items of 1,20€
  * Example 1: If the number of items is 4, no extra surcharge
  * Example 2: If the number of items is 5, 50 cents surcharge is added
  * Example 3: If the number of items is 10, 3€ surcharge (6 x 50 cents) is added
  * Example 4: If the number of items is 13, 5,70€ surcharge is added ((9 * 50 cents) + 1,20€)
  * Example 5: If the number of items is 14, 6,20€ surcharge is added ((10 * 50 cents) + 1,20€)
* The delivery fee can __never__ be more than 15€, including possible surcharges.
* The delivery is free (0€) when the cart value is equal or more than 200€. 
* During the Friday rush, 3 - 7 PM, the delivery fee (the total fee including possible surcharges) will be multiplied by 1.2x. However, the fee still cannot be more than the max (15€). Considering timezone, for simplicity, **use UTC as a timezone in backend solutions** (so Friday rush is 3 - 7 PM UTC).

##### Field details

| Field         | Type  | Description                           | Example value             |
|:---           |:---   |:---                                   |:---                       |
|delivery_fee   |Integer|Calculated delivery fee __in cents__.  |__710__ (710 cents = 7.10€)|

## Installation
1. Create an virtual environment (Python 3.10.10 used) 
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environement.
  - On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
  - On Unix or MacOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To desactivate the virtual environement:
  - On Window:
  ```bash
  path_to_env\Scripts\deactivate
  ```
  - On Unix or MacOS:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Database Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage
To start the development server, use the following command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver <address:port>
```
By default, the server uses localhost:8000. If you specify a different address, make sure to adjust the ALLOWED_HOSTS configuration in your [settings.py](woltBackend/settings.py) file to include that address. For example:
```
#setting.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '0.0.0.0', 'your_address']
```
Make sure to update this list according to your specific deployment needs.

## Calling the API with curl:
Exemple curl command:
```bash
curl --request POST "http://localhost:8000/deliveryCalculator/" --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"cart_value": 790, "delivery_distance": 2235, "number_of_items": 4, "time": "2024-01-15T13:00:00Z"}'
```

## Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```
